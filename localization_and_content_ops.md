# Localization & Content Operations Specification
Version: 1.0
Status: Developer-ready

## Purpose
Provide a framework for translating and managing all player-facing text, region events, missions, and Feed messages in Space Junkies. Ensure text is easy to update without code pushes, supports multiple languages, and respects theming (Star Trekâ€‘flavored but legally distinct).

---

## Scope
- UI text (buttons, labels, error messages)
- Game content (missions, port/sector descriptions, ship names, flavor text)
- Galaxy Feed message templates
- Seasonal event banners and notices

---

## Guiding Principles
- **Key-based lookups**: All text referenced by stable keys.
- **JSON catalogs**: Per-language JSON bundles loaded at runtime.
- **No hardcoded strings** in client or functions; all via catalog.
- **Server emits keys** for Feed/events; client renders localized string.
- **Fallback to English** if missing.
- **Pluralization & interpolation** supported via ICU MessageFormat.
- **Hot reload**: Content ops can update JSON in Firestore, CDN, or storage bucket; clients refetch on version bump.

## Structure

### Catalog Example (en-US.json)
```json
{
  "ui": {
    "auth.signInGoogle": "Sign in with Google",
    "auth.signInEmail": "Sign in with Email",
    "nav.map": "Map",
    "nav.ship": "Ship",
    "error.noTurns": "You are out of turns."
  },
  "feed": {
    "player.join": "{name} has joined the galaxy.",
    "combat.pvp.win": "A clash in the {region} ended with a victor.",
    "mission.complete": "A mission was completed in {region}.",
    "planet.captured": "A planet changed hands in {region}."
  },
  "missions": {
    "federation.supplyRun": "Escort a Federation convoy to {region}.",
    "pirate.raid": "Disrupt a trade route in the {region}."
  },
  "ships": {
    "rustbucketMk1": "Rustbucket Mk I",
    "cometRunner": "Comet Runner"
  }
}
```

### Firestore Index
```
/locales/{langCode}
  version:int
  catalog: map (nested)
  updatedAt: timestamp
```

Client caches `version`; refetches when `updatedAt` newer.

---

## Workflow
1. **String extraction**: Developers add new keys in English master.
2. **Translation**: Ops exports JSON, sends to translators, merges back.
3. **QA**: Translators test in build; check fit in UI (no scrollbars, truncation).
4. **Deploy**: Publish new JSON to Firestore bucket; bump version.
5. **Client refresh**: On login or background refresh, if version > cached, pull update.

---

## Galaxy Feed Templates
- All Feed entries use **template keys** and params.
- Example:  
  - Key: `feed.combat.pvp.win`  
  - Params: `{ region: "Outer Rim" }`  
  - Client renders localized string.
- Security: server never interpolates player names or sector IDs into public Feed.

---

## Content Ops Roles
- **Writer**: Adds mission text, flavor.
- **Translator**: Localizes catalogs.
- **Ops**: Publishes to Firestore/CDN, bumps version.

Access via a protected admin panel or CLI tool.

---

## Testing & QA
- Snapshot tests: all keys resolved in each supported language.
- UI screenshot tests per locale to catch truncation.
- Fallback coverage check: warn if >5 percent of keys fallback to English.
- Feed QA: simulate events to ensure templates resolve correctly.

---

## Languages Roadmap
- Phase 1: English, Spanish, German
- Phase 2: French, Japanese, Korean
- Phase 3: Simplified Chinese, Portuguese (BR)

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **String length growth**: mitigate with flexible UI and scaling fonts.
- **Out-of-sync catalogs**: mitigate with version checks and fallback.
- **Untranslated ship/faction names**: can remain English proper nouns.
