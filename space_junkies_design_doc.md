# Space Junkies â€“ Full Game Design Document

## 1. Core Concept
Space Junkies is a modern reimagining of the classic TradeWars 2002 with 20,000 sectors, dynamic trade, and faction-based progression. All gameplay is turn-based, with turns resetting daily at 00:00 UTC.

## 2. Turns System
- Turns are set at the **galaxy level**.
- All turns reset **simultaneously at 00:00 UTC** for all players.
- No option to buy additional turns; balance is skill, not wallet.

## 3. Economy and Ports
### Standard Ports
- Ore, Organics, Equipment trading.

### Advanced Ports
- Research Stations: Buy/sell tech, ship upgrades.
- Black Markets: Illegal goods, bounty contracts.
- Military Outposts: Heavy weapons, advanced defenses.

### Special Ports
- Federation HQ: Alignment missions, faction ships.
- Pirate Havens: Smuggling, raiding missions.
- Alien Outposts: Rare tech, experimental weapons.

### Pirate/Bad Ports
- Contraband Markets: High profit, high risk trades.
- Slaver Dens: Capture/sell workers (illegal, negative XP if caught).
- Rogue Shipyards: Cheap, unstable ship upgrades.

## 4. Factions
- Federation (lawful) vs Pirates (chaotic).
- Unlock faction-specific ships (20 total, 5 unique per faction).

## 5. Planets
- Can be discovered, colonized, upgraded.
- Workers gather resources.
- Defensive structures: Shields, turrets, mines.
- Planets can be raided or defended.

## 6. Progression & XP
- XP from trade, combat, faction missions, planet growth.
- Level unlocks: better ships, tech, faction ranks.
- Title system: Trader, Explorer, Warlord, Admiral, etc.

## 7. Galaxy Feed
- Read-only feed of **major galaxy events**.
- Examples: "New planet discovered," "Bounty claimed," "Player advanced to Pirate Warlord."
- **No specific sector data** is ever revealed.

## 8. UI & Menus
- No scrollbars; native mobile swipe scrolling only.
- Menus designed as full-screen panels, interlinked with clear navigation.

## 9. Victory Conditions
- Economic dominance (wealth).
- Military supremacy (ship/planet conquest).
- Faction supremacy (Federation vs Pirate influence).
